❇️ Hello✋

❇️ **Project Summary**:

* This project has been developed in order to enable users to communicate securely via e-mail. The project is designed to prevent cyberbullying, spam and abuse of e-mail forms. The form data submitted by users is processed only once and is cleared of harmful content. Thanks to this, both users can send data securely and the system is protected from abuse.

* The project has a modern design with a free template taken from **BootstrapMade**, and each user's information is saved securely. The data is stored in different file formats (CSV, HTML, JSON). This project makes the sending of e-mail secure, while at the same time helping to protect user data from unauthorized access.

#### **The Purpose of the Project:**
* The purpose of this project is to ensure the security of communication made via e-mail form and at the same time to combat cyberbullying. By receiving user information only once via form submission, systems that prevent abuse have been integrated.

####**Technologies Used in the Project:**
- **PHP**: Used to process form data, send e-mail, and store files.
- **JavaScript**: Used for functions such as disabling the button during form submission.
- **HTML/CSS**: A user-friendly form design is provided.
- **Session Management**: Used to prevent users from submitting the form more than once.
-**Data Storage**: The data is stored securely in CSV, JSON and HTML formats.
- **IP and Location Analysis**: Location information is analyzed via the IP address of the users.

####**Features:**
1. **Secure E-Mail Sending**: Users are allowed to send the form only once, and sending the form again is blocked.
2. **Cyberbullying Prevention**: Form data is saved and analyzed to prevent cyberbullying and abuse.
3. **Data Storage**: Form data is stored securely in CSV, HTML and JSON formats.
4. **Protection of User Information**: IP address, cookies and other personal data are processed securely.
5. **IP and Location Analysis**: Geographical location information is taken from the IP address of users and stored for security purposes.

#### **Code Information and Developer Notes:**

❗️ **mail_gonder/index.md** The backup service is disabled in the codes **.** By using these codes, you have eliminated the ability to automatically save data and store the saved data according to different file types and made it even more secure. The reason I added it is because I want him to save this data to a database in the future and work in a way that it will be managed and protected from a panel, and I needed to add it for my friends who can take this project as a basis and maybe evaluate it in a different way.

❗️ **Personal Information** Please let's pay attention to the protection of personal information, and as in the topic I mentioned above, the fact that backup data is open for sharing may mean that everyone can access it. I NEVER ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY for any stolen data. Because this is a simple test project and, as with any system, users need to pay attention.
